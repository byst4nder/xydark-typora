# XyDark Theme for Typora

A minimalistic theme for documentation, note-taking and code snippets. It contains a light theme, **xylight**, and a dark theme, **xydark**.

Tested on Linux. The dark theme does not currently support Windows "Unibody" style. Not fully tested, but should work on MacOS.

## How to install

1. Download [latest release](https://github.com/xypnox/xydark-typora/releases/latest).
2. Go to Typora Preferences, select "Open Theme Folder".
3. Copy or move .css files and the "xydark" folder (with fonts), into the newly opened folder.
4. Restart Typora, then select it from Themes menu.
